                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you’re not alone. Without question, many people feel strongly
                about certain foods they eat. And indulge in. These foods can actually help them to feel better about
                life and about themselves, they can provide confidence and reassurances for a better tomorrow, and they
                can impart a sense of nostalgia, creating opportunities to relish childhood memories of a food
                experience.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course, some of the foods that you indulged in may not always have been good for your health. At
                least that’s what you were told. These foods were most likely considered too rich or too fatty or too
                sweet or too spicy or even too big. And sometimes they actually were, as you found out first-hand an
                hour or two later. But you probably ate them anyway because they made you feel good, although you might
                also have felt some guilt doing so. But, hey, the devil made you do it.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Recent studies, however, are showing that some of these foods may not be as bad for you as originally
                was thought. In fact, preliminary findings suggest that some of these foods may have components that can
                offer health benefits. How true these findings are will depend on time, but for now, they can provide
                added incentive for lovers of certain foods.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Furthermore, advances in technology and new ingredient developments can help create more healthy,
                tastier products—ones that you can feel comfortable indulging in. Consider, for example, the recent
                impact that these ingredients have had—improved fat-replacement systems, sweetener alternatives,
                exciting flavors and seasonings from around the world, and combinations of these and other
                ingredients—and the potential impact they can have in developing foods for the next millennium.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these are only some of the ways that self indulgence or comfort foods are adapting to meet the needs
                and perceptions of today’s consumer. This article will look at some of these foods and drinks that can
                provide comfort, well-being, and pleasure. In particular, it will examine how these products have gained
                increasing attention in recent years, how they have changed or adapted, and how, in doing so, they have
                opened up newer or broader markets today.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But remember, just as beauty is in the eye of the beholder, the type of foods we indulge in depends on
                our own personal likes and dislike. There is no one universally agreed-on list of foods we indulge in.
                For that reason, this article will be adopting a format a little different than usual.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Food Technology Editor Fran Katz will pick 10 of her favorite “comfort” or “indulgence” foods and
                explain how they have changed over the years. Then, Associate Editor Donald Pszczola will do the same
                for his top 10. Both editors will be working independently, so neither will know what is on the other’s
                list.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then Associate Editor James Giese will compare both lists, providing assessment of the chosen foods, and
                adding a few of his own. James’ comparison and assessment will be followed by an overall look by
                Contributing Editor Pierce Hollingsworth at trends in the self-indulgence market.<br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have a food which you indulge in and which you feel has been the subject of increasing attention,
                feel free to send us a letter to the editor. Until then, please, feel free to indulge in this article.
