                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast food menus are tricky when you’re watching your weight or your
                health. Finding a healthy,
                well-balanced meal in most fast food restaurants is a challenge. But there are always choices you can
                make that are healthier than others. The following tips and menu recommendations can help you stay on
                track. <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aim to keep your entire meal to 500 calories or less. The average
                adult eats 836 calories per fast food
                meal-and underestimates what they ate by 175 calories. So don’t guess! Most chains post nutritional info
                both on their websites and at the franchise location. Take advantage of this information. <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Opt for foods that are lower in fat and higher in protein and fiber.
                Look for items with more good
                stuff, like fiber, whole grains, and high-quality protein. Also aim for options that are relatively low
                in saturated fats. And steer clear of all items that contain trans fats. <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bring your own add-on items if you really want a health boost. Even
                when you order wisely, it can be
                pretty tough to get enough fiber and other important vitamins and nutrients from a fast food menu. If
                you plan ahead, you can bring healthy sides and toppings like dried fruit, nuts and seeds, carrot
                sticks, apple or pear slices, and cottage cheese or yogurt. <br><br>
                
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The truth is that it’s extremely difficult to follow a healthy diet
                when you’re eating regularly at fast
                food restaurants. Fast food is typically loaded with calories, sodium, and unhealthy fat—often enough in
                one meal for an entire day. It also tends to be low in nutrients and almost totally lacking in fruit,
                vegetables, and fiber. The use of organic and fresh produce has become one of the defining
                characteristics of street food. Street food is a delicious and healthy food option
                at a much cheaper price. <br><br>

                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn’t mean you have to avoid fast food entirely. When you’re
                hungry and on the run, fast food can
                really hit the spot. It’s cheap, tasty, and, best of all, convenient. But while it’s okay to indulge a
                craving every now and then, to stay healthy you can’t make it a regular habit. The key is
                moderation—both in how often you frequent fast food chains and what you order once you’re there.
